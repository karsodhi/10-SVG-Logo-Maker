# SVG-Logo-Maker

# Description
 This app was created to further skills in node.  It allows you to create a basic shape (triangle, circle, and square) by asking you questions which you will answer.  It then takes those answers and generates an image for you.  This can be used to create things such as logos for companies or any image a person wants by inputting what they want in the template.

# Installation

Install inquirer to use this app

# Usage

Generate images based off of a question template that is given to you through the application.

# Credits
 Had help from the tutoring service given to us through Northwestern Coding Camp

# Testing

The index.test.js file contains tests that see if the proper information is inserted into objects by the classes. This is important bc the objects created by them are used to dynamically to insert data into a HTML format that will be used in our .svg file.
